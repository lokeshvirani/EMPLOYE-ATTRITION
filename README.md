# Employee Attrition Prediction
Employee turnover affects overall corporate performance, employee morale, and operational continuity, it is an important issue for firms. Excessive turnover rates can result in significant expenses for hiring, training, and knowledge loss within the firm. This comprehensive documentation guides you through analyzing employee attrition using a dataset. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning models.

### Project Steps

#### Dataset
The dataset contains employee information for predicting attrition, including attributes like age, daily rate, department, and more.

#### Data Preprocessing
1. **Encoding Categorical Columns:**
   Categorical columns were encoded using LabelEncoder.
2. **Normalizing Data:**
   A Gaussian distribution was created for each attribute. Attributes with a standard deviation below 0.8 were excluded after normalization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored the dataset to derive insights into employee characteristics and potential factors contributing to attrition.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Applied PCA for feature extraction and visualization.
